# Password Generator

## Description

The function of this website is to provide the user with a strong and secure password. The site gives the user the option to customize the password to be generated based on the criteria that best suites their use case. Options include length, and character type exclusions; such as Upper-case, Lower-case, Numerals, and Special characters. Additionally, the site includes sanity checks in the event that the user accidently inputs invalid data when prompted.

Crucially, the generated password ensures that at minimum one of every character-type the user selected is included in the generated password.
